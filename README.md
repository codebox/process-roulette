# Process Roulette

Play this game at your peril!
 
Process Roulette kills processes at random on your computer - you choose how many. 

Each process that is killed earns you points. You earn bonus points for killing processes started by other users, and a super-bonus if you kill a process owned by the root account.

But watch out! If a critical process is killed and your computer crashes, or if the game kills its own process and stops, you get nothing!
 
Do you dare to play?
