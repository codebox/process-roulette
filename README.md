# Process Roulette

Play this game at your peril!
 
Process Roulette kills processes at random on your computer - you choose how many. 

Each process that is killed earns you points. You earn bonus points for killing processes that belong to other users, and a super-bonus if you kill a process owned by the root account.

But watch out - if a critical process is killed and your computer crashes, or if the game kills its own process and stops, you score nothing!
 
Do you dare to play?
