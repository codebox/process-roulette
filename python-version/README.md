# The python version of CodeBox's Process Roullete
## Original- https://github.com/codebox/process-roulette
## Me - https://github.com/Mttgo


## Instructions
Save the code to a file with a .py extension, for example, process_roulette.py.
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
Run the Python script using the following command:

python3 process_roulette.py

This will execute the Python version of the script,
and you can play the game as described in the original script.
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to kill processes if you intend to run this script as it involves process termination.
